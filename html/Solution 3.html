            <span class="section_title article_animation">Abstract:</span><br><p class="p_article article_animation">The suggested energy harvester is built on a backpack, and it integrates seamlessly with the backpack's bulk to produce an oscillating system, allowing the human body trunk's kinetic motion to be captured and used to power a generator. As a backpack usually has two leg straps to increase the output efficiency, the energy harvester contains two sets of harvesting mechanisms, which are symmetrically constructed, as shown in figure 1.</p>
            <span class="section_title article_animation">Mechanism:</span><br><p class="p_article article_animation">A pulling wire with a hanger, as well as a roller, help compensate for each harvesting mechanism: a micro-generator, a gear train, and a wheel with an integrated spiral spring. The hanger is linked to one of the backpack's straps, and it drives the pulling wire and turns the roller wheel when the backpack oscillates during human walking.<br>Because human motion has a low frequency (approximately 1 Hz), the angular speed of the roller wheel is much lower than the speed desired for the generator to work efficiently; thus, a gear train is used to accelerate the rotation of the roller wheel and then drive the generator to produce electricity.<br>The spiral spring, coaxial with the roller wheel, acts as a restoring force for the pulling wire and is the energy harvester's final main component of the oscillation system. Except for the pulling wire and its hanger, all of the above components are combined in a case, which is attached to the backpack such that the weight of the harvester and the mass stored in the backpack serves as the seismic mass of the oscillation system.<br>As illustrated in figure 2, the energy harvester case, which contains the majority of the components, is linked to the backpack container. The hangers are connected to the backpack's straps, allowing relative movement between the backpack container's straps. This relative movement drives the generators.<br>Because the two generators' electrical outputs are irregular, a full-wave bridge rectification circuit is used to correct the power and generate a direct current, which is then temporarily stored in a battery. The collected electrical power from the battery may be utilized to charge a variety of portable electronic devices through a charging circuit and USB power connectors. Portable electronic gadgets may be powered indefinitely with this energy harvester instead of carrying a bulky battery with a large capacity.</p>

            <span class="section_title article_animation">Conclusion:</span><br><p class="p_article article_animation">In light of the worldwide energy crisis, which has thrown a shadow over Egypt and the Middle East, this initiative will give a clear answer, since it is estimated to contribute roughly 120 watts of electricity is widely used in Egypt and the Middle East.<br>This demonstrates that this approach will be a significant step toward attaining energy sustainability by offering a personal source for each resident to meet various objectives: -</p><p class="p_article article_animation">1- The individual's income will be adequately kept so that he may invest more wisely and at a lower cost. The total charge might be up to 10% of the original purchase price.</p><br><p class="p_article article_animation">2- The power provided in many areas will be better utilized to maximize the value of current resources and apply them to national initiatives.</p>
            <span class="section_title article_animation">Future work and suggestions:</span><br><p class="p_article article_animation">It's important to make full use of the project in the future. In the future, we must work on a variety of improvements that will play a significant role in increasing efficiency and the energy generated as a consequence. If the project is extensively implemented on a broad scale, a significant amount of energy will be generated. These energy quantities will not only help in reducing the use of non-renewable energy resources and hence the number of pollutants, but they will also assist in alleviating the present energy crisis. The project allows each individual to create around 44.4 watts of energy per hour while walking. So, let's imagine the whole people in the world using this generator, how much energy will be generated!</p>
