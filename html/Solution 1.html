            <span class="section_title article_animation">Abstract:</span><br><p class="p_article article_animation">This solution is about a flexible fabric that generates electric energy from heat or movement. It that can both conduct electricity and provide thermal insulation. Thermo electrics are not new, but they are made of materials that are brittle, heavy, and expensive. Carroll's fabric (Power Felt), on the other hand, is lightweight, feels like wool felt, and can cover surfaces or even be made into clothing.</p>
            <span class="section_title article_animation">Mechanism of Power Felt:</span><br><p class="p_article article_animation">It is made up of tiny carbon nanotubes locked up in flexible plastic fibers and made to feel like fabric as shown in figure 1. While energy cannot be "created" Power Felt can pull electric energy out of thin air, from heat and movement. Power Felt can turn heat - from your body, the sun, anywhere - into usable electricity. It depends on taking advantage of the temperature difference between its layers to generate energy. And unlike anything else, it can collect electricity from vibrations or movement at the same time - letting your smartphone case bounce on a car seat during a long drive could charge your phone. (Mechanism shown in figure 2).</p>

            <span class="section_title article_animation">Uses of Power Felt:</span>
            <p class="p_article article_animation">Potential uses for Power Felt include lining automobile seats to boost battery power and service electrical needs, insulating pipes or collecting heat under roof tiles to minimize gas or electric bills or covering clothing or sports equipment to monitor performance.</p>
            <span class="section_title article_animation">Advantages of Power Felt:</span>
            <p class="p_article article_animation">Power Felt is very useful in collecting the wasted heat energy that anything emits. For instance, it is very helpful for human in collecting the heat that his body emits, especially if the whole cloth he is wearing is made of Power Felt.</p><p class="p_article article_animation">1- Heat insulation:<br>Power Felt can also be used in heat-insulating and preventing heat leakage. So, if a house should be covered with a normal heat insulating material, Power Felt can be used to keep this house warm and at the same time generating electricity from this excess heat.</p><br><p class="p_article article_animation">2- Flexibility: <br>Power Felt is made from flexible materials so it can cover anything to take advantage of it. For example, Power Felt can be used in making clothes, mobile phone covers, even it can be used in covering a whole house, or any device.</p><br><p class="p_article article_animation">3- Collecting wasted heat energy: <br>Power Felt is very useful in collecting the wasted heat energy that anything emits. For instance, it is very helpful for human in collecting the heat that his body emits, especially if the whole cloth he is wearing is made of Power Felt.</p>

            <span class="section_title article_animation">Disadvantages of Power Felt:</span>
            <p class="p_article article_animation">1- The need for huge amounts of Power Felt:<br>For Power Felt to cover the whole surface of a house or a device or even in making clothes for humans, it needs to be produced in very large amounts so it can collect all the heat that the body emits. In addition to it is not made of one layer only, instead, it is made from a group of layers added to the fabric, and the total power output is equal to the contributions from each layer.</p><br><p class="p_article article_animation">2- The limited temperature of the heat source according to the number of fabric layers:<br>From the disadvantages of Power Felt that the amount of heat of the source it can tolerate depends on the number of layers of fabric and after that point the polymer begins to deform. This means that if it was needed to cover a very hot thing with Power Felt it should be thicker than normal Power Felt and this may increase its cost.</p>
