        <div class="p_container">
            <p class="p_article article_animation">Egypt is facing many problems and challenges that affect its economy and prosperity. One of the sectors that Egypt has a problem with is Energy. Egypt's energy sector is currently confronted with several competing and overlapping problems and challenges. This is mainly seen in Egypt’s arduous efforts to strike a balance between production, consumption, and export revenue while seeking to maintain internal political harmony. Although Egypt is Africa's largest non-OPEC oil producer and second-largest gas producer, as well as the critical position it plays in regional and global energy markets, the country's energy situation has deteriorated over the last four years on all levels. The energy resources are affected as the consumption of energy increases by an amount of 4% annually from the start of this millennium. <br>The global energy demand is rising all the time, but natural energy sources are becoming scarce. The possible solution for this problem is to generate electricity from alternative energy resources like solar power, wind, and hydro. The chosen solution is to make use of the human body's daily activities to generate energy. Human activities like breathing, running, sweating, and also the urine coming from the body can continuously generate electricity to be used.
                <span class="section_title article_animation">Causes:</span><br><b>- The use of non-renewable energy:</b> Egyptians rely heavily on non-renewable energy, choosing non-renewables such as oil and natural gas over renewables such as solar power, wind turbines, and hydroelectricity.<br><b>- The high price:</b> The high cost of the alternative energy resources is one of the factors affecting them, as using alternative energy costs a lot of money, and many technologies are used to generate and produce renewable energy. The low cost of fossil fuels is also a factor in the production of energy from a large number of non-renewable resources.<br><b>- Natural factors:</b> Natural factors have an impact on alternative energy sources such as renewable energy. For example, a cloud can obscure the sun, preventing solar power, which is a renewable resource, from being used. Also, there could be no wind in a region with wind turbines that aren't being used, which would have a significant impact on renewable energy.
                <span class="section_title article_animation">Impacts:</span><br><b>- Pollution:</b> there are many types of pollution that the usage of non-renewable resources of energy affect the environment, for example:<br><b>1) Air pollution:</b> When fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources are burned, toxins are emitted that can make breathing more difficult. Mercury causes developmental disorders in children and is toxic if ingested, making air pollution a serious problem. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, all of which may cause respiratory problems and other health problems, can be released by fossil fuels. The quality of the air will begin to deteriorate as more non-renewable energy is burned.<br><b>2) Land pollution:</b> Exploitation of nonrenewable resources can have negative environmental effects. Massive amounts of rock and dust must be dumped in other places to reach the coal underneath the surface. This has unintended implications for environments and ecosystems, and animals may be forced to migrate as a result. <br>
                 <b>- Accidents and Oil Spills:</b> During the extraction, refining, and transportation of fossil fuels, accidents may occur. Oil spills are particularly hazardous. They can deter tourists as well as sea life, wreaking havoc on coastal economies that rely on these industries. Food sources and habitats for several other species become extinct as a result of changes in sea life. Pipeline leaks, nuclear meltdowns, and even fires are all examples of events that can affect humans, animals, and the environment significantly. The consequences of these events are always serious, costing millions of dollars in restoration and permanently damaging parts of the environment that can take decades to recover from.<br><b>- Emissions of Greenhouse Gas:</b> Carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases are released into the atmosphere from nonrenewable fuels. These gases are referred to as greenhouse gases, and they cause global warming. Different types of fuels emit different amounts of greenhouse gases, with coal-producing the most. Natural gas is a cleaner alternative since it emits the least amount of carbon dioxide when burned. When this form of gas is extracted, it produces a significant amount of methane, which is a greenhouse gas. Weather trends are also evolving as more non-renewable resources are burned, affecting food production, animal populations, and critical biodiversity within habitats.
                 <span class="section_title article_animation">Positive consequences:</span><br><b>- Socially:</b> Coal and natural gas plant emissions have been related to health problems. The majority of these negative health effects are caused by pollutants in the air and water, which renewable energy technologies do not generate. Wind, solar, and hydroelectric power plants produce electricity without releasing any contaminants into the environment. Also, geothermal and biomass systems produce some air pollutants. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, can have a major effect on water resources: both coal mining and natural gas drilling can pollute drinking water supplies, and all thermal power plants, including those powered by coal, gas, and oil, use, and use water for cooling.<br><b>- Environmentally:</b> Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are overflowing our atmosphere as a result of human activity. These gases serve like a heat trapper, acting as a shield. As a result, a web of significant and harmful consequences has emerged. Coal and natural gas are the primary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. Many renewable energy sources, on the other hand, generate little or no global warming emissions. The global warming emissions associated with renewable energy are negligible. Increasing the supply of renewable energy would allow to replacement of carbon-intensive energy sources and significantly reduce global warming emissions. <br><b>- Economically:</b> The renewable energy industry is more labor-intensive than fossil fuel technologies, which are traditionally mechanized and capital-intensive. Humans are required to mount solar panels, and technicians are required to maintain wind farms. This means that for each unit of electricity produced from renewable energy, more jobs are created on average than from fossil fuels. Renewable energy can help keep energy prices low in the future. Renewable energy also facilities need initial capital investments, they can then operate at a very low cost (the “fuel” for most clean energy technologies is free). As a consequence, the price of renewable energy can be very constant over time.
                 <span class="section_title article_animation">Negative consequences:</span><br><b>- Socially:</b> <br> Health risks to workers: Coal mining and oil exploration are both hazardous jobs that result in a large number of illnesses, accidents, and deaths each year. Public health issues: Burning fossil fuels can cause lung problems and asthma attacks in humans due to their toxic air pollution. <br><b>- Environmentally:</b><br> Environmental pollution: Fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide, which is directly related to global warming, making them extremely harmful to our planet’s environment.<br><b>- Economically:</b><br> Rising costs: Fuel prices will rise without notice since only a few countries possess a significant amount of fossil fuels. They will run out: We won’t be able to use fossil fuels for our rising power needs until the earth's reserves of fossil fuels have been depleted (at least not for several hundred million years).
